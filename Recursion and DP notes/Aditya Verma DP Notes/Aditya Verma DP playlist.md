- Table generation in DP is top down approach, which is very difficult to do, so avoid writing code thinking about table generation. 
- DP is enhanced recursion: When we have smaller input values repeating, those values are stored in a table.
- How to identify dp: 
	- some choice is given, for eg, in knapsack we have choice to include or exclude a object. 
	- optimal value is asked in the question
